			 <p class = "p2">"My heart’s cry for every meeting held under the covering of Aglow is that we would be a living tabernacle for the Presence of God. Everything must flow from that place – growth, language, teaching, worship, prayer, planning, etc. The Holy Spirit has been our Leader from the beginning. As we approach the coming of Jesus, our sensitivity to His Presence and His leading must increase. We must be moving in such a way that others will desire to follow His leading simply by observing us. . . .
			<br/> <br/>
			"I find myself looking for the Presence of the Holy Spirit even in casual conversations. It is like looking for “the treasure in the field.” It is who we are. It is what we are about. And it is all about Him…always. It’s His Presence."
